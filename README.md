This project presents the study and comparison of two finite volume schemes for approximating the solution of a 2D diffusion equation. I describe the mathematical model, the domain meshing, the finite volume schemes used, and the approximation of diffusion fluxes on the edges.
Attached to the notebook and the mesh file is a compressed file containing the Manapy package that needs to be installed in your Python environment.
Please follow these steps:
*Extract the file content.
*Go to the Manapy folder (the path in which the setup.py file exists) and open a terminal in that folder.
*Run this commode line in your terminal, please don't forget the point at the end :     python3 -m pip install --user -e .
If you encounter any issues. Contact me :)

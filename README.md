This project presents the study and comparison of two finite volume schemes for approximating the solution of a 2D diffusion equation. I describe the mathematical model, the domain meshing, the finite volume schemes used, and the approximation of diffusion fluxes on the edges.<br>
Attached to the notebook and the mesh file is a compressed file containing the Manapy package that needs to be installed in your Python environment.<br>
Please follow these steps: <br>
*Extract the file content.<br>
*Go to the Manapy folder (the path in which the setup.py file exists) and open a terminal in that folder.<br>
*Run this commode line in your terminal, please don't forget the point at the end :  python3 -m pip install --user -e . <br>
If you encounter any issues. Contact me :) <br>
